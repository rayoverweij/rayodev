					Student designs of the future of AI in primary schools
				</h1>
				<p>
					In February and March 2025, 7 primary school classes across Scotland and the Netherlands participated in a workshop on the future of AI at school. In teams, students aged 9-12 reflected on opportunities for improvement at their school and designed an AI-powered tool that could help with their topic. This website showcases all of their ideas!
